## Overview
AI-based weather prediction system with a 5-day forecast, AI confidence levels, weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and location-based predictions. Currently using mock data, with plans to integrate real-time APIs and machine learning models for accuracy.

## Features
5-day weather forecast with AI confidence levels  
Historical prediction accuracy tracking  
Detailed weather metrics (temp, humidity, wind speed)  
Visual weather indicators (sunny, cloudy, rainy)  
Location-based predictions  
Responsive design for all screen sizes  

## Usage
Enter a location for a 5-day forecast  
View weather metrics and AI confidence levels  
Track historical prediction accuracy  
Visual indicators show weather conditions  

## Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time weather data (APIs)  
Implement machine learning models  
Add user authentication and dark mode
